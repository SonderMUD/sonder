3a. Stats
	Stats are rated on a scale of 1-5 for ordinary character objects. They are rated 5-10 for supernatural character objects. Every attribute starts out with one point in it.
	1 = Poor. Unexercised, unpracticed or inept.
	2 = Average. The result of occasional effort or application.
	3 = Good. Regular practice or effort, or naturally talented.
	4 = Exceptional. Frequently applied, tested and honed, or naturally gifted.
	5 = Outstanding. The peak of normal human capability. Continuously exercised or naturally blessed.

Groups:
Int, Wis, Res = Mental
Str, Dex, Sta = Physical
Pre, Man, Com = Social
New characters have a split of 5/4/3 points to assign to these groups.


Intelligence (self.db.intelligence)
	Cognitive ability, the power of the mind, memory, and book-smarts. Valued among scholars, theorists, and leaders.

Wits (self.db.wits)
	Street smarts! To think on your feet and act under pressure, you need wits. A favorite for lawyers, entrepreneurs, and tacticians.
	
Resolve (self.db.resolve)
	Ongoing focus, staying on target, the capacity to ignore distractions. Defense of the mind. Important to leaders, motivators, soldiers, and athletes.

Strength (self.db.strength)
	Physical might, muscle mass, effects anything that uses brawn or might. Instrumental to thugs, athletes, and brawlers.

Dexterity (self.db.dexterity)
	Quickness, response time, finesse. Valuable to criminals, surgeons, and dancers alike.

Stamina (self.db.stamina)
	How fast can you run? How much wood can you chop? It’s the difference between sick and frail, or hardy and healthy. Critical to athletes, survivalists, and heavy lifters.

Presence (self.db.presence)
	Attractiveness is only half the battle: this is your stage presence, your assertiveness, your bearing on the room. Can you control the crowd? Essential for models, rockstars, and salespeople.

Manipulation (self.db.manipulation)
	Your capacity to pull on the strings of others, using their emotions and needs to your own advantage, whether that be through a charming smile or an appeal to their heart. Vital for politicians, publicists, and cons.

Composure (self.db.composure)
	Are you calm and poised? You’d want to invest in composure. It’s the ability to remain cool in the face of stress, to resist pressure and social influence, whether they be internal or external. Ideal among leaders, soldiers, and anyone exposed to high levels of stress.
